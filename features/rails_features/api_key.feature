Feature: API key

Background:
  Given I set environment variable "BUGSNAG_API_KEY" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And I set environment variable "APP_PATH" to "/usr/src"
  And I configure the bugsnag endpoint

Scenario Outline: Setting api_key in environment variable works
  Given I set environment variable "RUBY_VERSION" to "<ruby_version>"
  And I set environment variable "BUGSNAG_API_KEY" to "b35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6ab"
  And I start the service "rails<rails_version>"
  And I wait for the app to respond on port "6128<rails_version>"
  When I navigate to the route "/api_key/environment" on port "6128<rails_version>"
  Then I should receive a request
  And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
  And the request used the "Ruby Bugsnag Notifier" notifier
  And the request contained the api key "b35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6ab"
  And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element

  Examples:
    | ruby_version | rails_version |
    | 2.0          | 3             |
    | 2.1          | 3             |
    | 2.2          | 3             |
    | 2.2          | 4             |
    | 2.2          | 5             |
    | 2.3          | 3             |
    | 2.3          | 4             |
    | 2.3          | 5             |
    | 2.4          | 3             |
    | 2.4          | 5             |
    | 2.5          | 3             |
    | 2.5          | 5             |
    | 2.5          | 6             |
    | 2.6          | 5             |
    | 2.6          | 6             |

 Scenario Outline: Changing api_key after initializer works
  Given I set environment variable "RUBY_VERSION" to "<ruby_version>"
  And I start the service "rails<rails_version>"
  And I wait for the app to respond on port "6128<rails_version>"
  When I navigate to the route "/api_key/changing?api_key=c35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6ac" on port "6128<rails_version>"
  Then I should receive a request
  And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
  And the request used the "Ruby Bugsnag Notifier" notifier
  And the request contained the api key "c35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6ac"
  And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element

    | ruby_version | rails_version |
